### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Slava, nice to meet you here.

Here are projects I work on:

- [Camo-rb](https://github.com/alexeevit/camo-rb) â€” an SSL/TLS image proxy that uses HMAC signed URLs
- [ColorName](https://github.com/alexeevit/color_name) â€” a simple ruby gem that allows to get the name of a color given as a hex
- [PSystem](https://github.com/alexeevit/psystem) â€” a rails-based prototype of a payment system
- [alexeevit/nvim_config](https://github.com/alexeevit/nvim_config) â€” my neovim config
- [Valera](https://github.com/alexeevit/valera) â€” a telegram bot with a Markov chain under the hood
